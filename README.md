Build your next workout with Spotter. Choose from our list of exercises and even add your own! :muscle::sweat_smile:

## What this project does ## 

This project usess `MySQL`, `Node`, `Express`, `Handlebars`, and a homemade `ORM`. `Node` and `MySQL` is used to query and route data in the app. `Handlebars` is used to generate the HTML. The `ORM` is used to query and manipulate data from the database using `JavaScript` rather than `SQL`.
